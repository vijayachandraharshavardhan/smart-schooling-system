# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide - UPDATED

## Prerequisites

### 1.2 Environment variables will be set in Railway dashboard
No need for local .env file - Railway handles this automatically!

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### 2.1 Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/smart-schooling-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Railway will auto-detect Django

### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to Variables tab and add:
```

```

## Troubleshooting
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
