### 4. Health Check

- [x] Home page `/` loads successfully (200 status) with school data

### 5. Template Tag Conflicts

- [x] WhiteNoise for static files included
- [x] dj-database-url for database URL parsing included

### 7. Runtime Configuration
- [x] `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11.0
- [x] `Procfile` configured for gunicorn
- [x] Build command uses `requirements_production.txt`
- [x] Start command includes migrations, superuser creation, collectstatic, and gunicorn

## üöÄ Deployment Ready

The Django application is now fully configured and ready for deployment to Render with PostgreSQL. All local testing with production settings passes successfully.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **render.yaml**: Added `DATABASE_URL` environment variable from Render's database
2. **config/settings_production.py**: Updated to use `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. **Template Tags**: Renamed conflicting `student_filters.py` in teacher app to `teacher_filters.py`
4. **Verification**: All database operations, static files, and application functionality tested locally

### Expected Behavior on Render:
- Application will start successfully
- Database migrations will run (though none pending)
- Superuser will be created if not exists
- Static files will be collected
- Health check will pass
- Home page will load with school information

## üìã Next Steps for Deployment

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Connect the repository to Render
3. Create a new Web Service on Render using the `render.yaml` blueprint
4. The PostgreSQL database will be automatically created by Render
5. Deploy the application
6. Access the application at the provided Render URL
7. Verify the health check endpoint: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health/`
8. Test the home page: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/`

## üîç Troubleshooting

If issues occur after deployment:
- Check Render logs for error messages
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is properly set in environment variables
- Ensure all migrations have run successfully
- Confirm static files are being served correctly
- Test database connectivity in Render's shell if needed
