# TODO: Prepare Django Project for Render Deployment with PostgreSQL

## Information Gathered
- The project is a Django application with multiple apps (users, admin_portal, teacher, student, etc.).
- Currently configured for Railway deployment, but has a basic render.yaml file.
- settings_production.py uses Railway-specific environment variables (PGHOST, PGUSER, etc.) for database configuration.
- render.yaml exists but needs updates for proper Render deployment.
- Healthcheck endpoint checks for Railway environment; needs to be updated for Render.
- runtime.txt specifies Python 3.11.0, but render.yaml has PYTHON_VERSION: 3.9; inconsistency needs resolution.
- requirements_production.txt includes psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL support.
- Procfile is present but Render uses render.yaml for configuration.

## Plan
- Update render.yaml for Render-specific configuration, including database setup and environment variables.
- Modify config/settings_production.py to use Render's DATABASE_URL instead of Railway-specific variables.
- Update config/healthcheck.py to include Render environment checks.
- Ensure runtime.txt and render.yaml use consistent Python version (3.11).
- Verify all dependencies and configurations are production-ready.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- render.yaml: Update service configuration, database setup, and environment variables.
- config/settings_production.py: Change database configuration to use DATABASE_URL, update ALLOWED_HOSTS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for Render.
- config/healthcheck.py: Add Render environment detection.
- runtime.txt: Ensure Python version consistency.

## Followup Steps
- Test database connection and migrations locally if possible.
- Verify static files collection and healthcheck endpoint.
- Ensure superuser creation works in production.
- Deploy to Render and check logs for any issues.

## Progress
- [x] Updated render.yaml: Changed PYTHON_VERSION to 3.11.0 to match runtime.txt, added RENDER environment variable.
- [x] Updated config/settings_production.py: Cleaned up ALLOWED_HOSTS for Render only, removed Railway/Heroku references.
- [x] Updated config/healthcheck.py: Added RENDER environment check in healthcheck response.
- [x] Simplified database configuration to use only DATABASE_URL for Render.
- [x] Updated CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for Render domain only.
- [x] Fixed static files directory check and added SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT.
- [x] Removed Railway-specific database fallback logic.
- [x] Removed debug logging code.
- [x] Ran final deployment checks - only minor warnings remain (SECRET_KEY length and template tag conflict).
- [x] Tested PostgreSQL database connection successfully with provided credentials.
- [x] Updated render.yaml to use requirements.txt instead of requirements_production.txt.
- [x] Removed unused database configuration from render.yaml (using external PostgreSQL).
- [x] Project is now ready for Render deployment with PostgreSQL.
