# üö® FIX RAILWAY HEALTHCHECK FAILURE

## ‚úÖ Build Successful, Healthcheck Failed

Your Django app is building correctly but failing the healthcheck. This means the app is not starting properly.

## üîß Common Causes & Solutions

### **1. Missing Environment Variables**

**Problem**: Django can't start without proper configuration
**Solution**: Set these environment variables in Railway dashboard

Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Variables tab and add:

```
SECRET_KEY=r(c6#w+f358j^2kurwv#t49dr@y3(!=9pq5^i^16%o7qnv_*25
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings_production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=False
```

### **2. Database Not Connected**

**Problem**: Django can't connect to database
**Solution**: Add PostgreSQL database

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway automatically sets DATABASE_URL

### **3. Missing Database Migrations**

**Problem**: Database tables don't exist
**Solution**: Run migrations

In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs ‚Üí Open Shell:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### **4. Static Files Not Collected**

**Problem**: Static files not found
**Solution**: Collect static files

In Railway shell:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```
